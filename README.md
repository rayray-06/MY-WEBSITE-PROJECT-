# MY-WEBSITE-PROJECT-
introduction- the aim of this project was to create a website using wireframes we created from our chosen website. i have created a website that mimics the wireframe with slight changes to benefits users.

Persona1(35 year old car buyer)
- As a car buyer i want to be able to easily view and filter through different bmw cars by model and payment type so i can narrow down the car that suits my needs
Persona2(loyal BMW customer)
- As a loyal customer i want to easily sell back my bmw at any time and have access to appropriate services.

Design choices 
- I used white text on a dark blue background to reflect the BMW barnding. furthermore i also used transparent black boxes over the background image to make the text readable.
- When it came to topography i used sans serif font as its clear and compatible accross multiple devices.
- I used HTML5 elements like <nav>,<main> and <footer>
- The BMW logo was sourced from wikipedia
   When it comes to wireframes. most of it was kept the same eg. the buttons and layout however i changed the colours used to suit the BMW theme.

Development choices
- Sidebar that has drop down options
- Main content briefly explaining the BMW used cars
- footer with navigation links
- link to real BMW used car website
